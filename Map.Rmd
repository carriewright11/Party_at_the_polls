## Precinct shape file outdate (up to 2018)

Information about this data is here: https://github.com/mggg-states/MD-shapefiles 

Michael has voter data for these files.

```{r, include = FALSE}
# load the packages we need
library(here)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(googlesheets4)
library(ggmap)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(sf)
```


```{r, include = FALSE}
# load the up to 2018 precinct shape data
precincts_to_2018 <- sf::st_read(here::here(
  "data", "MD_precincts_to_2018", "MD-precincts.shp"))
#filter to just Baltimore City
precincts_to_2018 %<>%
  filter(str_detect(pattern= "Baltimore City", string = NAME))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = precincts_to_2018[1:3], size = 1, color = "black", fill = "cyan") + 
  ggtitle("Precinct Boundary Plot") + 
  coord_sf()
```


Ideally also want 2020 shape files as well for the 2020 voter data files.
