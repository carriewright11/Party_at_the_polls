Code to wrangle and prepare the data for [this dashboad](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.dunphy8764/viz/BaltimoreVotesCoalitionDemo/Dashboard).

Work by Eliane Mitchell, Michael Dunphy, Wenhui Yang, and Carrie Wright as part of the [Democracy Data Science Hackathon](https://100percentdemocracy.substack.com/p/a-democracy-data-science-hack-a-thon?s=w) in 2022. 

Data for the dashboard has since been edited by others including work by Ugochi Ejiogu, Lauren Klein, Michelle Qin, and Michael Rosenblum in a different location.

Contributors for that project include: League of Women Voters-Baltimore City (especially Nancy Lawler, Billie Roberts Spann, and Flo Valentine), Michael Dunphy, and Sam Novey
